# Heart-Disease-Diagnosis-using-AI

Diagnosing Coronary Artery Disease with neural network built using Keras model

The project involves using a dataset from UCI repository where there are 76 attributes taken in consideration while diagnosing a heart disease

Out of these 76 attributes, the project utilises 14 main attributes with 302 instances

The project includes handling of missing data, building of a neural network model using keras, categorical classification, binary classification and a proper use of the dataset imported in the code

The diagnosis is carried out by both the categorical classification model as well as the binary classification model

Respective accracy and classification report is presented in the project for both the keras model
